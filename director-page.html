                        IIIT Bhagalpur is on a fascinating path of growth and development. As you
                        are aware, it has already made its impact as technological institutes in the
                        country, but that is just the tip of the iceberg compared to the huge initiatives
                        and progress the institute is making. The institute‚Äôs own campus on 50 acres
                        on the bank of river Ganga is fast getting ready to be operational within a
                        short span of time . We shall be going to occupy the first phase of the campus
                        by the end of Year 2020. The institute has increased its student strength from
                        a meagre 70 in 2017 to over 280 today which is likely to increase by 450.

                Indian Institute of Information Technology, Bhagalpur (IIIT Bhagalpur) is one of the IIITs
                set up by MHRD, Govt of India in Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode and it is an
                institute of national importance. It started functioning from the academic year 2017 in the
                city Bhagalpur.

                Bhagalpur is a city of historical importance on the southern banks of the river Ganges in
                the state of Bihar. The region has witnessed great educational history by having ancient
                universities such as Vikramshila University and Nalanda University.

                Indian Institute of Information Technology Bhagalpur is a joint venture of Govt. of India
                (50%), Govt. of Bihar (35%) and BELTRON (15%). The institute is fully residential and has
                separate hostels for boys and girls with proper security arrangements and other facilities.
                The institute started functioning from the year 2017 with B.Tech courses in two branches,
                namely Computer Science & Engineering and Electronics & Communication Engineering. Later
                considering the need of skilled manpower in the industry in the field of automation a new
                branch called Mechatronics Engineering was introduced in the year 2018. To excel in the
                field of research in the respective areas the institute will start M.Tech and PhD program in
                the respective areas from the next academic session.

                The institute has developed all the state of the art laboratories for the BTech curriculum.
                We have highly motivated and qualified faculties who have developed a world-class learning
                environment in the institute. The syllabus of IIIT Bhagalpur has been developed by the
                experts of the various domains taking into account the need of society and industry.

                A special course such as:

                Society ‚Äì Academia ‚Äì Industry Internship has been introduced in the curriculum for the
                summer break in 2nd, 4th and 6th semester to address the issues of the society.
                Further the curriculum also incorporates one semester the 8th semester of the curriculum
                completely vacant for the industrial internship.
                In addition to that foreign language course has also been introduced in the 7th semester to
                make them eligible to work in the global environment.
                The institute focuses on all round development of students, and enables them to have both
                soft skills as well as technical skills. I would like to invite all prospective employer and
                trainer from India and abroad to visit the campus for the internship/recruitment process. I
                am sure you will witness the outcome of excellence in teaching and learning environment
                created at IIIT Bhagalpur. The institute also encourages for pre placement talks/ early
                placement session/e-placement session. An information brochure has also been prepared to
                make you understand the academic program at IIIT Bhagalpur. I look forward to your
                wholehearted support and engagement with us.
